by Rikhat Akizhanov, Nuren Zhaksylyk, Aidar Myrzakhan

## Desciption

This project endeavors to innovate within the field of medical imaging by focusing on the development of a lightweight and efficient AI model that performs segmentation of images to identify health problems using just a mobile device. The core objective of this project is to combine ultrasonic technology, mobile devices, and neural networks to develop revolutionary diagnostic tools that is readily available, user-friendly, and reliable. We aim to design and validate lightweight neural network models capable of performing effective real-time instance segmentation on ultrasonic images.
